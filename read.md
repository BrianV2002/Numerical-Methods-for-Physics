# Numerical Methods for Physics

This repository collects numerical methods commonly used in **theoretical and computational physics**, with an emphasis on understanding the **mathematical ideas and workflows** behind each technique rather than focusing on software engineering details.

The codes are written mainly for learning, testing, and reproducible experimentation. Each folder corresponds to a **conceptual topic**, and contains a short `README.md` explaining what is being done and how to run the examples.

## Philosophy of the Repository

This repository is **concept-driven**:

* Mathematics first, implementation second
* Clear separation between numerical ideas and code details
* Designed as a personal reference and learning archive

Each folder is self-contained and can be read independently, but together they form a coherent path through modern numerical physics.
